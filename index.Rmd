Hi there! My name is Alec Becker.

I'm a **data scientist** passionate about learning new tools, solving tough data problems, and teaching others. I aim for clear **communication** that's as understandable to laypeople as it to experts. My goal is to help others gain useful **insights** and make accurate **predictions** with data.

I'm employed at the [A.J. Drexel Autism Institute](https://drexel.edu/autisminstitute/) where I work on public health and policy research. In my role, I apply advanced statistical and machine learning methods, create publication-quality visualizations, and manage a team of junior analysts. I work with data like large health insurance claims databases, surveys, and publicly available data from the US Census and other sources. I have a Master's in Spatial Analysis from Johns Hopkins University.

I'm comfortable with a range of data science tools including R, Python, SAS, and Stata. I know my way around point-and-click visualization software like Tableau and Power BI, but prefer to make visualizations and dashboards with R and Python as much as possible. This website was made with R ([R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html), to be precise).

Feel free to contact me at alecbecker1@gmail.com if you'd like to connect about freelance projects, professional advice, or training and tutoring related to data science.
